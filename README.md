## Introduction

NumPy is the core library for numerical and scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently.

This repository includes detailed explanations and examples of NumPy attributes and functions, which are provided in the `numpy.txt` file.

## Installation

To install NumPy, you can use pip:
```bash 
pip install numpy
```



# NumPy Basics

## Attributes
The following basic attributes of NumPy arrays are covered in the numpy.txt file:

* ndarray.ndim: Returns the number of dimensions of the array.
* ndarray.shape: Returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the array.
* ndarray.size: Returns the total number of elements in the array.
* ndarray.dtype: Returns the data type of the elements in the array.

## Functions
The numpy.txt file also includes detailed explanations and examples of essential NumPy functions, such as:

* numpy.reshape: Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.
* numpy.resize: Returns a new array with the specified shape.
* numpy.tile: Constructs an array by repeating array.
* numpy.append: Appends values to the end of an array.
* numpy.concatenate: Joins a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.
* numpy.split: Splits an array into multiple sub-arrays.
* numpy.mean: Computes the arithmetic mean along the specified axis.
* numpy.std: Computes the standard deviation along the specified axis.
* numpy.sum: Sums the elements of an array along the specified axis.
* numpy.prod: Returns the product of array elements over a given axis.

# Usage

* To use the attributes and functions of NumPy, first import the NumPy library
* Then, you can create arrays and use the attributes and functions as needed
* For more detailed examples, refer to the numpy.txt file.
